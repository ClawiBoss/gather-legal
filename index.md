# Privacy Policy — Gather

**Last updated: March 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how Gather ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our iOS application, Gather (the "App").

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### a) Account Information
When you create an account or sign in, we collect:
- **Email address** — used to identify your account
- **User ID** — a unique identifier assigned by Firebase Authentication
- **Display name** (if signing in with Apple or Google, and you choose to share it)

We do **not** collect your full name, phone number, location, or payment card details directly.

### b) Grocery List Data
Your grocery lists, items, and templates are stored locally on your device using SwiftData. We do not currently sync this data to our servers.

### c) Purchase Information
If you subscribe to Gather Pro, the transaction is processed entirely by Apple via the App Store. We do not receive or store your payment card details. However, we use RevenueCat to manage subscription status, which may receive:
- Subscription and purchase history (e.g., active plan, renewal dates)
- A RevenueCat-generated anonymous customer ID
- Device identifier (IDFV — Identifier for Vendor, not tied to your personal identity)

### d) Usage Data
RevenueCat may collect anonymous usage signals (e.g., which in-app purchase screens were viewed) to provide subscription management analytics. We do not collect additional analytics, crash reports, or usage telemetry beyond what Apple provides through App Store Connect aggregated metrics (which are anonymous).

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your account information solely to:
- Authenticate your identity so you can access your account
- Allow you to sign out and sign back in across sessions

We do not use your personal information for advertising, profiling, or selling to third parties.
